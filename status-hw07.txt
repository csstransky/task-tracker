Web Dev Spring 2018 HW07 Status

Answer the following questions:


1. What's your name?
Cristian Stransky


2. What's the URL of the github repo with your work for this HW?
https://github.com/csstransky/task-tracker/tree/part2


3. What's the version number of your github release?
v1.2


4. What's the URL that you deployed to?
hw08.cstransky.me


5. Is your app functionality complete? If not, what's missing?
No, if there's more than 1 time block, the time update button ONLY works
for the top time block. I figured the issue has to do with how JS handles
global variables, and I would have to give an index value here for this button
in the file for lib/task_tracker_web/templates/tasks/show.html:

<td><button id="time-update-button"
    data-time-block-id="<%= time_block.id %>"
    data-task-id="<%= @task.id %>"
    data-update-path="<%= Routes.time_block_path(@conn, :update, time_block.id) %>"
    class="btn btn-primary">Update Time</button></td>
    
I think what happened was because it made a list of time blocks, the button only 
existed for the top time block.
              

6. Is your app properly deployed? If not, what went wrong?
Yes, deployment went well.

Yes.
